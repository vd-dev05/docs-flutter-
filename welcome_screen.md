# Welcome Screen Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Welcome Screen in the BlaBl√≥ App, which serves as a transition between the intro screens and the main onboarding flow.

## Overview

The Welcome Screen is a standalone screen that appears after the intro screens and before the goal selection screen. It features:

1. A gradient background
2. The fox character (Hiro) with a speech bubble
3. A celebration effect around the fox
4. An "I'm ready" button that navigates to the goal selection screen

## Screen Flow

The navigation flow involving the Welcome Screen is as follows:

```
Intro Screens ‚Üí Welcome Screen ‚Üí Goal Selection ‚Üí Speaking Feeling ‚Üí Sign In
```

The Welcome Screen is distinct from the 3 intro screens and serves as a transition point before the user begins the actual onboarding process.

## Implementation Details

The Welcome Screen is implemented in `lib/presentation/pages/welcome/welcome_screen.dart` and includes:

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- A gradient background with light blue and light pink colors
- A fox character with a celebration effect
- A speech bubble with a welcome message
- An "I'm ready" button that navigates to the goal selection screen

## Usage

The Welcome Screen is typically navigated to:

1. After completing the intro screens
2. After completing the onboarding process (from the Done Screen)

When the user taps the "I'm ready" button, they are navigated to the Goal Selection Screen to begin the onboarding process.

## Design Considerations

- The screen follows the design specifications with a curved speech bubble and celebration effects
- The button color is a bright pink (0xFFFF4DCA) to match the design
- The fox character is positioned at the bottom of the screen
- The speech bubble contains the text "Welcome üëã I'm Hiro, Let's start our adventure! üëç"

## Related Components

- `CelebrationEffect`: Creates the particle animation around the fox character
- `NavigationHelper`: Handles navigation between screens
- `LayoutConstants`: Provides responsive layout values
